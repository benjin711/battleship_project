# battleship_project
10 days project of TUM C++ basic course.

We worked on the project in a team of three. The members were randomly chosen by the professor. There were Florian Danner, 
Verena Feierle and I (Benjamin Jin). I uploaded this project to my Github account so that personnel manager can have 
an insight on my level of object oriented programming in C++. 

Our assignment was to write an object oriented "Battleship" program in C++ within 10 days. There should be a network part,
a graphical user interface and the logic of the game included in the program. We split the work up accordingly:

Member                    Responsibility
Florian Danner            Network
Verena Feierle            GUI
Benjamin Jin              Logic

We used the QTCreator as IDE and GitLab was our version control software provided by the TUM.
With no experience in programming projects of this scale we faced difficulties of all kinds. We worked together every single 
day during these 10 days and overcame software problems when first using QTCreator, GitLab and Doxygen, communication problems 
concerning the QT specific signal and slots and time problems.

In the end we managed to produce a well functioning, but certainly not flawless program. 

Features that made our program stand out: 
1) We were able to play against battleship programs written by the other participating teams.
2) We included the function to place the ships randomly instead of just manually.
3) We also included a function to simplify the manual placement of ships. 

Our projects was graded 1.7. 

Before uploading this project to my github account I fixed a few minor bugs that we weren't able to fix during the 10 days 
because of lack of time. 

Now if you feel like playing battleship with someone, here are the instructions:
