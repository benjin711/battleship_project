# battleship_project
Technical University of Munich Battleship Project C++

Our task was to implement the game battleship with GUI and network in a team of three in an object oriented style. We used the QTCreater to create network and user interface.

The project was split into three parts: Florian Danner worked on the network, Verena Feierle worked on the GUI and I (Benjamin Jin) worked on the logic part of the game. 

I wrote the code in the following files: game.h, game.cpp, player.h, player.cpp, board.h, board.cpp, ship.h, ship.cpp. And helped writing the code in controlls.h and controlls.cpp as well.
