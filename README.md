# battleship_project
10 days project of TUM C++ basic course.

Our task was to implement the game battleship with GUI and network in a team of three. We used the QTCreater to create network and user interface.

The project was split into three parts: Florian Danner worked on the network, Verena Feierle worked on the GUI and I worked on the logic part of the game.
